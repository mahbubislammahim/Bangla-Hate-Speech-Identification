Detecting hate speech on social media is essential for safeguarding online communities, yet it remains challenging for low-resource languages like Bangla due to class imbalance and subjective annotations. We introduce a two-stage cascaded framework with $k$-fold ensembling to address the BLP Workshop 2025 Shared Taskâ€™s three subtasks: 1A (hate type classification), 1B (target identification), and 1C (joint classification of type, target, and severity). Our solution balances precision and recall, achieving micro-F1 scores of $0.7331$ on 1A, $0.7356$ on 1B, and $0.7392$ on 1C, ranking 4th on 1A and 1st on both 1B and 1C. It performs strongly on major classes, although underrepresented labels such as sexism and mild severity remain challenging. Our method makes the optimal use of limited data through $k$-fold ensembling and delivers overall balanced performance across majority and minority classes by mitigating class imbalance via cascaded layers.
