## üéØ **HIGH IMPACT IMPROVEMENTS (2-3% boost)**

### 1. **Data Augmentation** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Expected Improvement**: 1-2%

```python
# Already implemented in improved script:
# - Synonym replacement for minority classes
# - Back-translation augmentation
# - Balanced dataset creation
```

**Why it works**: Addresses class imbalance and increases training data diversity.

### 2. **Model Ensemble** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Expected Improvement**: 1-2%

```python
# Train 5 models with different seeds
# Average their predictions
# Use weighted voting for better results
```

**Why it works**: Reduces variance and improves generalization.

### 3. **Cross-Validation Training** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Expected Improvement**: 1-1.5%

```python
# Use 5-fold cross-validation
# Train 5 models on different folds
# Ensemble their predictions
```

**Why it works**: Better model generalization and more robust evaluation.

### 4. **Test Time Augmentation (TTA)** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Expected Improvement**: 0.5-1%

```python
# Apply augmentation during inference
# Average predictions from multiple augmented versions
# Use 3-5 augmentations per sample
```

## üîß **MEDIUM IMPACT IMPROVEMENTS (1-2% boost)**

### 5. **Better Hyperparameters** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Expected Improvement**: 0.5-1%

```python
# Learning rate: 3e-5 (instead of 5e-6)
# Batch size: 8 (instead of 4)
# Sequence length: 256 (instead of 128)
# Epochs: 5 with early stopping
```

### 6. **Focal Loss** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Expected Improvement**: 0.5-1%

```python
# Handles class imbalance better than CrossEntropy
# Focuses on hard examples
# Reduces overfitting to majority classes
```

### 7. **Advanced Preprocessing** ‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Expected Improvement**: 0.5-1%

```python
# Remove URLs, mentions, hashtags
# Normalize Bangla characters
# Add special tokens for context
# Clean whitespace and formatting
```

### 8. **Learning Rate Scheduling** ‚≠ê
**Expected Improvement**: 0.3-0.5%

```python
# Cosine annealing with warmup
# Adaptive learning rates
# Better convergence
```

## üìà **LOW IMPACT IMPROVEMENTS (0.5-1% boost)**

### 9. **Feature Engineering** ‚≠ê
**Expected Improvement**: 0.3-0.5%

```python
# Text length, word count
# Punctuation count
# Character statistics
# Combine with BERT features
```

### 10. **Advanced Architecture** ‚≠ê
**Expected Improvement**: 0.3-0.5%

```python
# Additional attention layers
# Custom pooling strategies
# Multi-task learning components
```

## üí° **PRO TIPS**

### 1. **Start Simple**
- Run the improved script first
- Get baseline improvement
- Then add advanced techniques

### 2. **Focus on Data**
- Data augmentation gives the biggest boost
- Quality > Quantity
- Balance your classes

### 3. **Ensemble Wisely**
- Use different seeds
- Different architectures if possible
- Weight by validation performance

### 4. **Monitor Carefully**
- Watch for overfitting
- Use early stopping
- Track both accuracy and F1

---

## üîç **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### If accuracy doesn't improve:
1. **Check data quality** - Ensure augmentation is working
2. **Reduce learning rate** - Try 2e-5 or 1e-5
3. **Increase epochs** - Train longer with early stopping
4. **Check class balance** - Ensure all classes are represented

### If model overfits:
1. **Add more dropout** - Increase to 0.4-0.5
2. **Reduce model size** - Use base instead of large
3. **More regularization** - Increase weight decay
4. **Early stopping** - Reduce patience

## üìû **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Run the improved script** - Should get you to 75-76%
2. **Add cross-validation** - Should get you to 76-77%
3. **Implement advanced techniques** - Should get you to 77-78%

**Goal**: Beat the 76% baseline and reach 77-78% accuracy!
